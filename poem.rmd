## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->
A BOAT beneath a sunny sky,
Lingering onward dreamily
In an evening of July --
Children three that nestle near,
Eager eye and willing ear,
## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->
The farmhouse lingers, though averse to square
With the new city street it has to wear
A number in. But what about the brook
That held the house as in an elbow-crook?
I ask as one who knew the brook, its strength
## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->
"The sun was shining on the sea,
Shining with all his might:
He did his very best to make
The billows smooth and bright --
And this was odd, because it was
The middle of the night.
The moon was shining sulkily,
Because she thought the sun
Had got no business to be there
## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->
