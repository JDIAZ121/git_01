## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->
A BOAT beneath a sunny sky,
Lingering onward dreamily
In an evening of July --
Children three that nestle near,
Eager eye and willing ear,
## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->
The farmhouse lingers, though averse to square
With the new city street it has to wear
A number in. But what about the brook
That held the house as in an elbow-crook?
I ask as one who knew the brook, its strength
## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->
"The sun was shining on the sea,
Shining with all his might:
He did his very best to make
The billows smooth and bright --
And this was odd, because it was
The middle of the night.
The moon was shining sulkily,
Because she thought the sun
Had got no business to be there
## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->

Beneath the sky so wide and blue,
The world awakens fresh and new.
The river hums its silver song,
A melody that drifts along.

The trees lean close, their whispers blend,
Like secrets shared between old friends.
The mountain wears a crown of snow,
While valleys dream in fields below.

A hawk arcs high with steady grace,
The sunlight painting lines of space.
The meadow blooms with gentle fire,
Each flower reaching, climbing higher.

The wind moves soft through golden grain,
A fleeting dance, then still again.
The stars prepare their quiet show,
Their lanterns flicker, soft and slow.

And in this scene, a heart can find,
A deeper calm, a clearer mind.
For every dawn begins the same,
Yet every day writes out its name.

So walk with hope, let burdens fall,
The earth has room and time for all.
And though the night may veil the skies,
Tomorrow waits with brighter eyes.
